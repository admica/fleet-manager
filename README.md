fleet-manager
=============
Eve Online fleet manager -- This is a fork of a fork of Agony Unleashed's NEO Fleet Manager program.  

TODO's:

1. Update all css files to Bootstrap or similar modern css framework.
2. Rid the Fleet Manager of its reliance on the extJS library (which has a convulated license structure, is using an ancient version, and kind of a pain to work with).
3. Create a proper "install" script (maybe).
4. Create some sort of admin front end.
5. Add columns for cyno's and sebo's.
6. Change it so you can limit usage by corp and/or alliance, have multiple corps authorized to use it, or even possibly set it to public.
7. Crapton of updating of items database.
8. Add estimated DPS calculation (base DPS? all 5's DPS? something in between?)
9. Currently any limitation based on corp and/or alliance IDs is seriously lame, because it's easy to spoof the IGB browsers.  Ultimately would be best to provide some sort of easy way of linking it into an existing auth system (such as TEA, forums, SSO, whatever).  May or may not address this issue, just not a big issue for us at this point.
10. Add default index files to every subdirectory for a modicum of security.
